<blockquote>
<p>NOTE:&mdash;No instrumental survey of the
whole cave has ever been made, and no exact
scale can be given.  The above are some of
the distances as paced along the avenues.
Domes, halls and pits are relatively enlarged;
and rivers and pools are blackened.  The
data for this new Guide map is from the
earlier maps of Bogert (1814), Ward (1816),
Lee (1835), Bishop (1845), Blackall (1817-pub.
1899), Forwood (1875), Hovey (1887)
and Call (1897), and from written and oral
information by managers and guides, modified
and greatly added to by the author&rsquo;s
own observations during the past twenty-seven
years.</p>
<p>NOTE No. 2:&mdash;In the year
1905 Max Kaemper, a German
Engineer, was employed
to make a complete survey
exclusively for the use of the
owners.  Some of his suggestions
are embodied in this
map of 1909, and others in
the separate charts for the
several routes.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>A Personal Word. I imbibed an early taste for the
sciences from my father, the late Professor Edmund
Otis Hovey, D. D., one of the founders of Wabash
College, and a pioneer geologist in Indiana. My annual
vacations, during a busy professional career spanning over fifty
years, have largely been given to underground explorations.</p>
<p>When fifteen years old I began cave-hunting amid the
charming grottoes near Madison, Indiana. An enthusiastic
comrade, six years my senior, then proposed that we visit the
Mammoth Cave. For certain reasons, while he went on, I got
no farther at that time than Louisville; where, however, I
bought, at the bookstore of Morton and Griswold, a copy of
&ldquo;Rambles in the Mammoth Cave, by a Visitor.&rdquo; It was just
out. It fired my boyish imagination, and it gave shape to
much of my after life.</p>
<p>More than four hundred books, pamphlets, scientific reports,
and magazine articles have been published by different writers,
besides innumerable newspaper contributions, about Kentucky&rsquo;s
great cavern. Copies of most of these are in the author&rsquo;s
library.</p>
<p>Yet there is a demand, and there seems to be room, for such
a practical, condensed, and up-to-date hand-book as is now
offered. It does not claim to tell all that might be told; and
it omits much material that might interest the historian or the
scientist. Its design is to aid the average visitor as he follows
the four regulation routes by which the Cave is ordinarily
exhibited.</p>
<p>Those who covet more abundant information as to places
not often visited, or concerning the cavern fauna and flora,
or as to details of local history, or as to Mammoth Cave bibliography,
are referred to the larger Illustrated Manual of Mammoth
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Cave, by Hovey and Call, published by John P. Morton
and Company, and for sale at the Cave. My still more comprehensive
work on &ldquo;Celebrated American Caverns,&rdquo; now out
of print, may be found on the shelves of most public libraries.</p>
<p>The revised Guide Map (1907 and 1909) in this volume,
and for sale (on a larger scale) at the Cave hotel, was made
by me from an original partial survey, earlier charts being
consulted, especially those by Stephen Bishop and Dr. C. R.
Blackall, with a few corrections and additions suggested by
Mr. Max Kaemper, to whom thanks are also due for important
facts concerning his discoveries in 1908. The route-sketches
found in this hand-book were redrawn from those made by him.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments are likewise due to my son, Dr. E. O.
Hovey, of New York City; to my former comrade in cave-hunting,
Dr. R. Ellsworth Call; to Benj. F. Einbigler, Norman A.
Parrish, and others, for valuable correspondence and memoranda;
to the late Mr. Ben Hains and Mr. H. M. Pinson,
photographers; to Mr. H. C. Ganter for use of copyrighted cuts;
to the officials of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for
additional illustrative material, as well as for other courtesies
and favors; and particularly to the trustees, managers, and
guides of Mammoth Cave for heartily and generously facilitating
explorations in former and more recent years, without
which this work would have been impossible.</p>
<p>Finally, for information as to trains via the Louisville and
Nashville Railroad and connections at Glasgow Junction with
the Mammoth Cave Railroad; for the arrival and departure
of steamboats on Green River; for terms of Cave routes and
guides, and for hotel rates by the day or the week, and for
other details not within the scope of this hand-book, application
may be made to the Mammoth Cave Manager, at Mammoth
Cave, Kentucky. Our simple aim is to aid and entertain
the reader in his subterranean rambles.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">A Short Lesson In Geology and Chemistry</span></h2>
<p>Many hurry to and through and away from Mammoth
Cave; but let us go in a more leisurely manner.
Suppose we begin by a stroll amid the rounded hills
that environ Cincinnati. We find their flanks full of
corals, shells, crinoids, and other marine objects by myriads.
These are fossils, yet perfect as if freshly cast up from the sea.
But we observe that the limestone lies in thin, level layers,
with no signs of volcanic or earthquake action. They were
gently cut down by an undermining process that left no
caverns, because the strata are so thin that they can not hold
together. This is the same Lower Silurian formation that elsewhere
made the famous &ldquo;bluegrass region,&rdquo; causing Central
Kentucky to be the fairest bit of the globe&rsquo;s surface known.</p>
<p>Go by steamboat down the Ohio to Madison, Indiana, and
the scenery changes with the geology. Near the river are
still seen the thin blue limestone strata that we saw at Cincinnati,
but capped by the marble heights of the Upper Silurian.
Cascades from the cliffs wash out the thinner, softer material,
making wide, shallow grottoes, each being, as a rule, at the
head of a ravine, which is a cave in ruins.</p>
<p>At the charming city of Louisville we encounter another
geological change, and meet a striking proof that the region
was once flooded by the ocean, namely, the grand old coral
reef over which tumble the Falls of the Ohio. It used to
bristle with branching corals like stag-horns and was strewn
with tens of thousands of more delicate varieties, car-loads
of which have since been carried away; but enough remain to
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
show that all this country was uplifted by continental forces
from a primeval sea. Probably its altitude was once above
the present level, to which it has been reduced by causes some
of which are still at work.</p>
<p>Rambling through the valleys and examining their rocky
beds, we find fissures no doubt caused by that continental
uplifting to which we have referred. These cracks, or &ldquo;joints,&rdquo;
are visible over large areas, wherever the country rock is
exposed. Usually they run at nearly right angles with one
another, north and south lines crossing those from east to west.
The joint-walls may closely fit, or have been parted to make
channels by which falling rain might be drained.</p>
<p>You have noticed that soda-water roughens and eats away
the marble slab on which the soda-fountain rests. On asking
the reason you are told that it is due to the carbonic acid gas
(carbon dioxide) with which the water is charged. In nature
this same gas is formed by the decay of animal and vegetable
matter. Rainwater absorbs it from the atmosphere and while
sinking through the loam and soil. It also takes up humous
acids, which aid in the work of corrasion effected on reaching
the limestone. Mechanical energy assists chemical action in
slowly dissolving and removing the limestone particles.</p>
<p>All limestone caves, great and small, were carved by this
slow yet irresistible process. The downward flow follows the
joints till a lateral &ldquo;bedding-plane,&rdquo; or something else, turns
the stream horizontally, when there results a widening of the
passageway. Should the roof collapse there would be &ldquo;a
tumble-down&rdquo; within and perhaps a &ldquo;sink-hole&rdquo; without.
Should the cave cut through from one bedding-plane to another,
a series of galleries would result; the upper ones dry as
tinder and the lower ones wet with water that finally reaches
the drainage level, whence it emerges into some open valley.</p>
<p>Occasionally the whirling water bores straight down through
all galleries, making what is termed a pit, or a dome, according
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
to the point of view. Standing pools deposit nitrous earth
and various other mineral substances. Water trickling through
the roof evaporates, each drop laying down its load of the
bicarbonate of lime to create a stalactite; or a stalagmite if it
first falls on the floor. A general and convenient term is
&ldquo;dripstone,&rdquo; masses of which are found at almost any crossing
of the joint-planes. Should &ldquo;fixed air&rdquo; (carbon dioxide), which
is fifteen times as heavy as the atmosphere, settle into the lower
parts of any cave, it would make visiting dangerous or fatal.
But air currents and other causes make every part of Mammoth
Cave free from any except the sweetest, purest air ever inhaled.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small">Approaching Mammoth Cave</span></h2>
<p>According to an authentic article in the Louisville Courier-Journal
for September 29, 1901, the managers of Mammoth
Cave, having occasion to examine the records at Bowling Green,
found that cave designated as a corner of a section of land in
1797; which antedates by some years the threadbare legend
of Houchins and the wounded bear.</p>
<p>During the saltpeter times, 1812-1816, elsewhere described,
men came and went in carts or on horseback. Seventy years
ago Dr. Davidson told the Transylvania University about
visiting the &ldquo;Green River country,&rdquo; so called in honor of General
Nathaniel Green, the hero of Eutaw Springs&mdash;not for its
emerald tint. He hired a barouche at Henderson and traversed
a dozen counties to Mammoth Cave, which Dr. John Croghan
had just purchased for $10,000, intending to &ldquo;clear out the
avenues and make them accessible for an omnibus to the
distance of three or four miles, and erect a sort of hotel in
the Temple&rdquo; (the old name of the Chief City).</p>
<p>Charmingly did Julius Benedict, sixty years ago, narrate
the adventures of Jenny Lind and her party, as they went
&ldquo;by the very worst road in the United States, but amid most
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
delightful forest scenery,&rdquo; from Nashville to Bowling Green,
and thence to Bell&rsquo;s Tavern, that famous old hostelry. The
rest of their journey lay along the edge of &ldquo;jagged, abrupt
glens, along sweeping meadows and budding woodlands,&rdquo; to
the queer old building where &ldquo;Dr. Croghan did the honors of
his subterranean dominions in the most agreeable manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As recently as my own early visits a line of stage coaches
ran from Cave City, owned by Andy McCoy and managed by
Henry C. Ganter, who still entertains willing listeners at the
Cave hotel by his racy stories of pioneer days. How grandly
the bugle-flourish used to herald the coming stage-coach, and
how everybody used to rush to greet the passengers, and how
eagerly the negro servants cared for the luggage! Guests still
come by carriage, on horseback, or by automobile; and many
avail themselves of the steamboats plying on Green River,
where a system of locks and dams has made it practicable to
land within half a mile of the Cave entrance. No more delightful
river-ride than this can be found in the Middle West, or
more diversified by frowning cliffs, wild forests, opening
amphitheatres that smile in summer with rustling fields of corn,
with here and there attractive villages and flourishing cities.</p>
<p>But the majority avail themselves of the Louisville and
Nashville Railroad, connecting with the Mammoth Cave Short-line,
whose terminus is near the Cave hotel. One enjoys the
comforts of modern travel while passing by a magnificent
panorama of hill, valley, and undulating plain. &ldquo;Knobs&rdquo;
several hundred feet high, capped by the Chester sandstone,
above the solid St. Louis limestone, appear as cones or pyramids,
whose strata remain horizontal from base to apex.
Amid the Knobs run stream-swept valleys. In level regions
are fertile farms, though frequently the soil is iron-stained
a fiery red. One could hardly find anywhere a more charming
trip by rail than from Louisville to Glasgow Junction, or one
more unique than from the latter station to Mammoth Cave.</p>

<div class="pcap">In Cave Costume</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Oval depressions abound, styled &ldquo;sink-holes,&rdquo; because
through them the surface water sinks out of sight. So numerous
are they that one might traverse the cave-region on horseback
all day long and not cross an open stream; all the rainwater
being drained through them to underground gathering-beds,
to re-appear in such cave-fed streams as Green River.
The Short-line Railway from Glasgow Junction to Mammoth
Cave passes a number of remarkably large sink-holes, one of
the widest being &ldquo;Eden Valley,&rdquo; covering two thousand acres,
with no inlet or outlet except through pits that are conjectured
to lead to the Colossal and the Mammoth caves.</p>
<p>On the authority of the late Professor Shaler it is said that
there are four thousand sink-holes and five hundred known
caverns in Edmondson County alone. In this little hand-book
we can not be expected to give a list of them. In the vicinity
of Mammoth Cave are several that have celebrity, and would
amply reward the attention of a visitor. Among them may
be mentioned Ganter, Diamond, Procter, Salt, and White
caves. The last two belong to the Mammoth Cave estate, and
are occasionally visited by tourists. The Salt Cave is remarkable
for prehistoric relics, and the White Cave for its stalactites.
Dixon Cave also is noteworthy as having probably been the
original mouth of Mammoth Cave. It is an immense chamber,
fifteen hundred feet long, from sixty to eighty feet wide, and
from eighty to one hundred and twenty-five feet high, and
was once worked for saltpeter. The Colossal Cavern, belonging
to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, is but a mile and a
half distant, and is noted for its magnificence.</p>
<p>Thus far the woodman&rsquo;s axe has spared the grand old forest
trees on the estate, except as needed for firewood, and many
delightful rambles are to be had among them. Game used
to abound, and still rewards the skillful hunter, and Green
River abounds in fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small">Ownership of the Cave</span></h2>
<p>Mr. McLean bought the Cave and two hundred acres around
it, in 1811, for forty dollars, and soon sold it to Mr. Gatewood,
who in turn sold it to Messrs. Gratz and Wilkins, who sent
Mr. Archibald Miller from Philadelphia to manage saltpeter
works for them during the War of 1812, at a time when an
embargo cut off foreign sources of supply. The Cave estate, with
sixteen hundred acres of land, passed into the hands of Mr.
James Moore, a Philadelphia merchant, in 1816, and when he was
ruined by the Burr and Blennerhasset fiasco, Gatewood took it
again and made it a &ldquo;show-cave.&rdquo; Mr. Frank Gorin bought the
property in 1837, and made Miller and Moore his agents, with
Stephen Bishop and Matt Bransford as guides. Discoveries followed
so fast as to draw public attention at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The fame of this natural wonder reached a young physician
of Louisville, Dr. John Croghan, while traveling in Europe,
and on his return he became so charmed with the Cave that
he bought it from Mr. Gorin for $10,000, and also purchased
two thousand acres about it, in order to control any other
possible entrances than the main one. To the original miner&rsquo;s
cabin, Mr. James Miller, his agent, added in 1835 the long row
of log cabins still used by guests; since joined by wide porches
and modernized by frame additions and all conveniences.
Among the agents who have exhibited the Cave or run the
hotel, or both, are Messrs. Archibald, James, William, and W.
Scott Miller, Larkin J. Procter, Mr. Owsley, D. L. Graves, Francis
Klett, W. C. Comstock, Henry C. Ganter, and L. F. Charlet.</p>
<p>The will of Dr. Croghan, probated February 5, 1849, left
the entire Mammoth Cave estate in the hands of trustees for
the benefit of his nine nephews and nieces, namely, the sons
and daughters of Colonel George Croghan and General T. S.
Jesup; with the proviso that when they should all have died,
the trustees should sell the estate at public auction. Unless
some of the heirs should buy it, a desirable purchaser might
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
be the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company; or the entire
group of caverns in the vicinity might be converted into a State
or national park. Meanwhile we are content that it should
remain under the excellent management of the present trustees.</p>
<p>No guides are employed but those who are trustworthy.
Stephen Bishop and Matt Bransford have passed away; so have
Nicholas Bransford and William Garvin. Tom Lee, my first
guide, and John M. Nelson, with whom I have made many
an underground trip, are not now in service. Those whom one
is likely to meet at present are Edward Bishop, William Bransford,
Robert Lively, and Joshua Wilson, with several other
capable guides at hand for emergencies. All are heroes of
many adventures, and their strong arms have rescued many a
visitor from disaster. Their word is law, and no one is allowed to
enter without a guide. Hence accidents are of rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The fact so widely heralded that, in the spring of 1909,
a party of &ldquo;Shriners&rdquo; got lost in the Cave for eight hours,
was wholly due to their refusing to obey the guides, and breaking
away from their comrades under the voluntary and unauthorized
leadership of one of their own number. As soon
as possible guides were dispatched to their rescue, who brought
them safely out to the open air.</p>
<p>For the convenience of visitors, as well as with reasonable
consideration for the guides themselves, certain hours and
routes are fixed, from which it is not customary to depart,
unless by special arrangement with the management. Four
routes are mapped out, the uniform charge for each being two
dollars. For terms for the season, or for large parties, etc.,
as well as for information as to hotel rates, and indeed for anything
special, visitors should apply to the Mammoth Cave
manager. Cave suits are to let, and proper methods of illumination
are provided by the guides. Even a few hours of wandering
below ground will be worth while; but those who can remain
amid these wonderful scenes for a longer period will be amply
repaid by incessantly varying sights and experiences.</p>

<br />Echo River, Pits and Domes</h2>
<p>A pathway from the Hotel winds through the garden, down
amid the forest, crossing a wagon road to Green River, and
then brings us to the only known entrance to Mammoth Cave.
Evidently it is where the roof broke down long ago; for the
lower valley was doubtless once part of the cavern, and so
was what is now known as Dixon Cave. The present Cave
mouth is seven hundred and thirty-five feet above sea level,
one hundred and ninety-four feet above the level of Green
River, and one hundred and eighteen feet below the crest of
the overhanging bluff. The limestone stratum is three hundred
and twenty-eight feet thick, measuring from the sandstone
above to the drainage level below; and within these limits all
the vast labyrinth extends its ramifications.</p>
<p>One of the first things noticed by the visitor is the strong
current of cool air that flows from the Cave mouth, frequently
too strong to allow the carrying of lighted lamps until a point
is reached many yards within, where the gale dies away. As
we descend the solid stone stairway we observe with pleasure
a waterfall that leaps from the ledge, gleams in the sunlight,
and vanishes amid the rocks on the floor. Around us hang
festoons of vines and ferns, and before us is the noble vestibule
to a temple of eternal night.</p>
<p>An iron gate is unlocked for us, put there to prevent unpaid
intrusion and vandal spoliation. Passing through, we bid
farewell to daylight, and depend on the simple iron lamps
given to each of us by the guide. The legend that a hunter
named Houchins, in 1809, chased a wounded bear into this
throat of the cave, whether authentic or not, is perpetuated
in the name given it, Houchins&rsquo; Narrows, made still narrower
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
by the blocks of limestone piled in walls on either side, thus
leaving a passage only a few feet wide. To the left is the tomb
of two Indians found in early days and reburied here. No
monument marks the grave of these nameless aborigines.
Considering the fact that the Cave was resorted to by many
generations of red men, it is remarkable that so few human
remains have rewarded diligent search.</p>
<p>What are these wooden pipes along the floor? They were
laid there by the saltpeter miners to convey the water from the
cascade at the entrance down to the leaching vats that are now
pointed out to us in the Rotunda. The ruts of old ox-carts are
visible in which the &ldquo;peter-dirt&rdquo; was carried to the vats from
the open avenues, while sacks were used for those more remote.
The solution was pumped out to open-air boilers, run through
ash-hoppers, cooled in crystallization troughs, and packed for
transportation to the seaboard, mostly by mules. Thus did
patriotic Kentucky supply the government with one of the
ingredients of gunpowder, at a time when foreign sources were
cut off. The yield of nitrate was four pounds to the bushel
of soil, and the vast heaps of lixiviated earth seem to warrant
the boast that Mammoth Cave alone &ldquo;could supply the whole
population of the globe with saltpeter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lofty arch of the Rotunda is directly under the Hotel;
and it would be possible, by means of a shaft, to supply every
room with the sweetest and purest air, transforming it into
a &ldquo;lime-air&rdquo; sanitarium, as has actually been done in some
other localities. By a series of temperature observations
with verified thermometers, the writer has proved that
the uniform temperature of the Cave is 54&deg; Fahr., winter
and summer; and the air is chemically and optically pure.
Lighted by magnesium fire the grandeur of this first of
many halls is made visible, as are also the openings of two
broad avenues, one of them being the Main Cave and the
other the entrance to Audubon Avenue and Little Bat
Avenue. Here in winter assemble myriads of bats from all
the region around, clustering in nooks and crevices for their
long sleep of hibernation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>

<div class="pcap">Entrance to Mammoth Cave</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Leaving Audubon Avenue to be described in Route II,
we enter from it, at a point some five hundred feet from the
Rotunda, and by a low arch, the winding way known as Little
Bat Avenue, chiefly remarkable as leading to the Crevice Pit,
which is immediately over the Ruins of Karnak. The story
is told by the late Dr. R. M. Bird that a former owner, Mr.
Wilkins, let a lamp down the pit by a rope that caught fire,
with the loss of the lamp. A reward of two dollars was offered
for its recovery. A little darkey agreed to be let down, as a
sort of living plummet, to sound the depth of the chasm. He
told such a tale as to the magnificent temple underneath, with
its tall columns and splendid adornments, that nobody believed
him. Thirty years later the lost lamp was found by old Matt,
the guide, who gave it to me.</p>
<p>The Main Cave, or Grand Gallery, or as we like to style it
the &ldquo;Broadway&rdquo; of this subterranean metropolis, extends
from the Rotunda to the Cataracts, and must be traversed to
reach any other part of the cavern. In this first route only
about eight hundred yards of it are shown.</p>
<p>High overhead springs an arch eighty feet wide and resting
on vertical walls. Presently the guide calls our attention to
the exit of the Corkscrew, on our left, an extraordinary passageway
by which we are to return after visiting the River Hall.
If we happen here as another party is returning, a curious
effect is produced by their torches emerging one at a time in a
procession winding down the Kentucky Cliffs. But now we
advance along the worn cart-road made by the saltpeter miners,
strewn by their ancient log-conduits, which are strangely preserved
during the century that has elapsed since some of them
were first brought hither. Lift one and you will be astonished
to find how light they are. At the junction of the Main Cave
and Archibald Avenue is the &ldquo;Church,&rdquo; where the pious miners
used to hear the message of salvation taught by itinerant
preachers, and where in more recent days many a sermon has
been preached and many a psalm been sung, awakening echoes
from the cavern walls.</p>

<div class="pcap">Leaving the &ldquo;Corkscrew&rdquo;</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Reserving the Gothic Avenue for another visit, we note, as
we pass along, the grotesque figures of animals and birds made
by the deposits of the black oxide of manganese overhead.
Mark well the Standing Rocks, which fell edge-downward ages
ago, set free from the roof possibly by some earthquake shock.
Now we walk awe-struck under the Grand Arch, where the
guides effect a marvelous surprise by means of simple illumination.
They burn chemical fires at a point near the saltpeter
vats, some five hundred feet to the rear of us, and the contour
of the walls brings out a statuesque effect which is aptly styled
&ldquo;Martha Washington&rsquo;s Statue.&rdquo; It requires but little play
of the imagination to fancy it a marble representation of that
eminent lady of Colonial times.</p>
<p>An immense rock lies near the right-hand wall, forty-five
feet long, eighteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high, which used
to be called the Steamboat; but it is now known as the Giant&rsquo;s
Coffin. The quasi-sarcophagus may have been torn from the
adjacent wall by some convulsion, or it may simply have
fallen and lodged in its present suggestive position. Its weight
is estimated at two thousand tons. It is one of the great
landmarks, and though we should pass it many times it is
impossible to do so without being impressed by its solitary
grandeur, rivaling as it does the blocks of Baalbec in Syria.</p>
<p>The route now taken leads us behind the Giant&rsquo;s Coffin,
through a low and narrow passage which would never have
been discovered had not the monster rock fallen. This is
styled Dante&rsquo;s Gateway, from which a rude stairway leads
us into the Wooden Bowl Room, so named either from its
peculiar shape or because an Indian wooden bowl was found
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
there. To the left is the opening to what has variously been
styled Indian Avenue, Blacksnake Avenue, and Welcome
Avenue. Really it is a combination of several avenues, running
for the distance of eight thousand five hundred feet, as measured
by the writer, which have been made passable by the skill and
industry of Mr. H. C. Ganter when he was manager of the
Cave, and which for this reason is generally called Ganter
Avenue. Its inner end is at Serpent Hall, and it gives an
exit for any one who may get caught beyond the rivers by a
sudden rise of water.</p>
<p>Our present path goes through the &ldquo;Dog-Hole,&rdquo; down a
stairway fancifully called &ldquo;The Steeps of Time,&rdquo; leading into
the region of pits and domes. We pause a while by Richardson&rsquo;s
Spring, which is a small pool filled by a running stream
that has worn for itself a narrow channel in the rock, illustrating
what has been done for the entire Cave on a grander scale.
Small crustaceans are found in this clear pool, and blind insects
abound under the flat rocks near by. Numberless blind
crickets leap away from us, and white eyeless spiders, brown
beetles, thousand-legged worms, and other abnormal forms
of life are found by careful search. Nothing harmful, however,
appears, either here or elsewhere. As a rule cave-life is
timid.</p>
<p>Side-saddle Pit, fifty feet deep, was named from its imagined
resemblance to a lady&rsquo;s saddle. Above it rises Minerva&rsquo;s Dome,
thirty feet high. The spot used to be dangerous, but is now
guarded by a stout railing. Once a terrier leaped down the
Chasm after a fire-ball flung by a guide. The guide&rsquo;s wife
allowed herself to be lowered by a rope and rescued the poor
dog, which did not seem to be seriously hurt by his perilous
adventure. Calypso&rsquo;s Avenue, to the left, leads to the Covered
Pit and Scylla and Charybdis, which are rarely visited.</p>
<p>Near the entrance to the Labyrinth is a window through
which we behold the wonderful and lofty chamber discovered
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
by a former owner of the Cave, Mr. Frank Gorin, in whose
honor it is named Gorin&rsquo;s Dome. Perhaps the earliest account
of it was that published by Dr. Davidson. Its height, as
measured by myself with the aid of a cluster of small balloons,
is one hundred and sixty feet, its width is thirty-five feet and
its length sixty feet. Its vertical walls sweep in an S-shaped
curve and spring from the river level to the apex of the dome,
with projecting bosses of coral and with cascades that awake
the echoes as they fall.</p>
<p>Darnall&rsquo;s Way was cut through the sandbank, in 1896,
to the summit, where a bridge cast directly across the abyss
gives us the most complete view to be had of the locality.
One remarkable feature is a folded alabaster curtain one
hundred and nineteen feet high. By casting fire-balls down
the whole interior is grandly illuminated. Davidson descended
to the bottom, as others have occasionally done since, by
means of a well some thirty feet deep, down which one clambers
like a chimney-sweep. He found there &ldquo;stretching away in
midnight blackness a horrid pool of water.&rdquo; In 1863 Mr. F. J.
Stevenson, of London, had a boat made and lowered through
the window, on which he floated away for seven long hours
on a perilous voyage that no man has since then repeated.
The water now setting back from Green River has closed the
entrance to what we term &ldquo;Stevenson&rsquo;s Lost River&rdquo;; but
his old boat still lies where it was stranded at the bottom of
Gorin&rsquo;s Dome.</p>
<p>Another huge abyss, the Bottomless Pit, was long regarded
as ending further progress, till Stephen Bishop crossed it in
1840 by means of a slender cedar sapling thrown over the
yawning gulf; since when it has been spanned by a substantial
and safe bridge. Instead of being &ldquo;bottomless&rdquo; it is exactly
one hundred and five feet deep. Above it is Shelby&rsquo;s Dome,
named for the first Governor of Kentucky. Balls of cotton
waste saturated with coal-oil are flung down by the guides,
which grandly display the wrinkled and corrugated walls of
the pit. Looking directly across, we see an opening through
which the writer and William Garvin emerged from their
explorations around Scylla and Charybdis. There are other
ways of approach, one from Gorin&rsquo;s Dome, another from near
the Scotchman&rsquo;s Trap, and still another from River Hall to the
very bottom, from which the upward view almost equals that
from the base of Gorin&rsquo;s Dome. All this great group of pits
is connected below to form an immense hall, about four hundred
feet long, which at high water is flooded by the overflow from
River Hall. By Special permission, of former President of the
United States Benjamin Harrison, this vast room was named
Harrison Hall.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>On crossing the Bridge of Sighs we find an enlargement of
the Cave formerly used as a dining place, and hence known
as Reveller&rsquo;s Hall. Pensico Avenue, along which we go, is
crossed underneath by an invisible passageway, causing sounds
to be reproduced in Echo Chamber with marvelous reverberations.
Wending our way amid the huge rocks that encumber
Wild Hall we next reach the Grand Crossing, and beyond it
the singular dry stalactite, the Pineapple Bush, and end our
path in Angelica&rsquo;s Grotto, with its curious Hanging Grove.</p>
<p>Retracing our steps to Reveller&rsquo;s Hall, we descend by an
opening overhung by an enormous slab so poised as to make
it seem as if a careless breath might make it fall. This is the
Scotchman&rsquo;s Trap, so named for a canny Scot who refused
to go farther lest he should be entrapped. But we dive under
and go on, coming presently to the Fat Man&rsquo;s Misery. This
is a serpentine passage, its walls changing direction eight times
in two hundred and thirty-six feet, its width but eighteen
inches and its height in places only five feet. It is indeed
enough to try a fat man&rsquo;s soul and body. The sides are marked
by ripples and waves, and are polished by the friction of
many vexed visitors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The fattest man that ever went through weighed two
hundred and eighty-two pounds at the start, but avers that
he lost twenty pounds in the process. Another, a jovial son
of Erin, stuck fast and was left to his fate. Later he turned
up all right and explained matters in his own way. He said
that he remembered every sin he had ever committed; and
when he called to mind how, at a certain recent hotly contested
election, he voted the wrong ticket by mistake, it made
him feel so small that he got free from the Fat Man&rsquo;s Misery
quite easily.</p>
<p>The room into which we emerge is fitly styled &ldquo;Great
Relief&rdquo;; and from it we enter the Bacon Chamber, where
Nature in a frolicsome mood has carved the limestone into
masses resembling rows of hams and shoulders in a packing-house.
Near by is the Dining Hall, where, on occasion, well-filled
tables are spread.</p>
<p>A special trip can be made through Spark&rsquo;s Avenue, entered
from Bandit Hall, and leading on to the Mammoth Dome.
We first visited it in 1878, and were assured that no one had
been there for seven years. A treacherous old ladder was
then the only means of descending to the floor, which sloped
away to a pool whose waters received a cascade falling from
the lofty apex. The ladder has been replaced by a substantial
stairway, by crossing which we reach the Egyptian Temple,
or the Ruins of Karnak. Six columns eighty feet high and
twenty-five feet in diameter stand in a semicircle, each deeply
fluted, veneered by yellow stalagmite and covered by mimic
tracery. Overhead is the black opening already mentioned
as the Crevice Pit; and underneath are extensive catacombs
rarely visited. Dr. Call&rsquo;s measurement of the extreme height,
from the cascade pool to the summit of the dome above the
Crevice Pit, was one hundred and fifty feet; which was later
confirmed by my balloon system of measurement. The total
length of the room is not far from four hundred feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>River Hall, to which we now return, might be said to extend
for miles, were we to include all the known branches of subterranean
waters. So unlike is it to the Main Cave that we
might almost be said to have entered another cavern&mdash;which
would really be true. What is called in a general way Mammoth
Cave is a congeries of different caves, whose walls and floors
were first thinned and then broken through by the agency of
water, until was formed the immense and greatly diversified
labyrinth whose mazes we are exploring. Here is the gathering-bed
of hundreds of sink-holes opening from the surface. The
exit is in deep, bubbling pools along Green River, of which the
Upper and Lower Big Springs are examples. And when
Green River is flooded by freshets its waters back through such
secret channels and also flood River Hall by a body of water
from thirty to one hundred feet in depth and fully two miles
long, with capricious currents and perilous whirlpools. Navigation
at such times is forbidden; but at low water it is entirely
safe, under the care of our skillful guides.</p>
<p>Sullen waters reposing at the foot of a cliff sixty feet high
are called the Dead Sea, though not bitter but sweet, as those
may find who venture down to the margin. An iron railing
guards the way as we descend to a lower terrace. Presently,
on the right, we see a cascade, that falls into a funnel-shaped
hollow and vanishes. Near by, in 1881, the writer found a
natural mushroom bed, that suggested the idea of a mushroom
farm, but with meager results because located in Audubon
Avenue, where irrigation is impracticable.</p>
<p>The black waters of the River Styx wind between steep
walls for some four hundred feet, and with an average breadth
of forty feet. Formerly it was passed over by boat, but now
by a natural bridge protected by a guard-rail. Lake Lethe is
next in order, along whose border we go cautiously, in hope
of seeing specimens of the famous eyeless fish (<i>Amblyopsis
speleus</i>) that abound in these waters. They seldom exceed
three or four inches in length, are colorless, have cartilage
instead of bones, are viviparous, and are so sensitive to approach
that they dart away if a grain of sand falls on the water.
The blind white crawfish (<i>Cambarus pellucidus</i>) is often seen.
These creatures were first described by Dr. Davidson, two
years previous to their being mentioned by DeKay, who was
credited by Agassiz as their discoverer.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The Great Walk for four hundred yards used to be admired,
but now its beautiful yellow sand is covered by the back-water
from the rivers. The roof here is mottled like snow-clouds.
Midway the mask of Shakespeare is pointed out, and other
objects of interest are visible. Stephen Bishop, John Craig,
and Brice Patton first crossed these rivers, over which thousands
have since safely voyaged. A fleet of flat-boats awaits us, the
material for which was brought in by way of the Crevice Pit.
Each boat has seats for some twenty persons, while the guide
propels the primitive craft by his paddle.</p>
<p>Four arches open to the Echo River, only the fourth being
ordinarily available. To reach this we cross the Sandy Sahara
and flounder through the Slough of Purgatory. The voyage
abounds in most enjoyable adventures, though care must be
taken not to upset amid waters that have no shores except
at the landing-places. A few years ago a party, mainly of
journalists, managed to swamp their boat, but were rescued
by the presence of mind of all concerned, particularly the
strong-armed and faithful guide, John M. Nelson, whose orders
they obeyed.</p>
<p>Echo River varies in width from twenty to two hundred
feet, under an archway averaging thirty feet in height, the
depth varying from five to twenty-five feet, and its level being
only about twenty feet above that of Green River. The portion
over which visitors are taken is perhaps half a mile or more
long. All along its margin, where the rock abruptly meets
the water, are countless cavities that have been washed out
by the stream. These gave a wag in our party on first crossing
the river his chance, and he cried, &ldquo;Oh, see these little bits of
caves, three for five cents!&rdquo; Then awoke the echoes and
carried the sound away and away till he was ashamed of himself.
Then a lady in black velvet Cave costume, with tiny bells along
the fringe to keep her from getting lost, sang the &ldquo;Sweet Bye
and Bye.&rdquo; A revolver was fired, answered by a &ldquo;Rebel Yell.&rdquo;
Flute and cornet were played with magical effect.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The term &ldquo;echo&rdquo; misleads; for what is given is really a
wonderful prolongation of sound, lasting five, ten, or even
twenty minutes. The tunnel&rsquo;s own key-note when struck
excites harmonics of depth and sweetness, along with a profound
undertone. When the guide agitates the water a myriad
tiny silver bells tinkle, followed by heavier ones as the waves
strike the cavities along the walls. This tempest of harmony
dies away with strange mutterings, as if of an angry mob.
Mr. Ganter tells of a time when the writer fooled him by causing
unearthly shrieks, as of wretches in mortal agony, at an hour
when none were on the river but themselves.</p>
<p>Here ends the First Route. We retrace our steps as far
as Bandit Hall, where some one raises the question if there is
no way out but by Fat Man&rsquo;s Misery. The guide answers,
&ldquo;Yes, by the Corkscrew,&rdquo; adding the warning, &ldquo;Those who
come in by the Fat Man&rsquo;s Misery go out by the Corkscrew,
and those who come in by the Corkscrew go out by the Fat
Man&rsquo;s Misery: and whichever way they take, they wish they
had taken the other.&rdquo; So, up we scramble like so many rats,
under or over great ledges, leaping from rock to rock, or climbing
ladders, through what seems like an enormous pit that had
been filled in with gigantic rocks, till at last, breathless, we
emerge upon the Kentucky Cliffs in the Main Cave. A few
steps carry us past the saltpeter vats, through the Rotunda,
and the iron gate is unlocked to let us into the vestibule, whence
we climb the stone stairs to daylight.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><br /><span class="small">ROUTE II</span>
<br />Olive&rsquo;s Bower, Star Chamber, and Gothic Avenue</h2>
<p>After a suitable period of rest and refreshment at the Hotel
we resume our way along the same path taken for the first
route, but presently deviate to explore Audubon Avenue, of
which we had only seen the beginning. It is related that when
the great ornithologist visited Rafinesque, the former smashed
a fine violin in his eagerness to capture a unique specimen of
the bat family. As a kind of amicable revenge the latter
affixed Audubon&rsquo;s name to this avenue, where so many myriads
of bats annually hibernate. It is fitting that the great branch
to the left, sweeping for three hundred and fifty feet and
suddenly ending in a tumble-down, should be named Rafinesque
Hall. Unless our visit is in late fall or winter, we find but
few clusters of bats; but in cold weather they gather here
from near and far and hang head-downward till somehow,
by a sense not explained, they know it is warm weather out-of-doors,
and then fly forth to the forests. Dr. Call boasts of a
single catch that gave him six hundred and seventy bats, of many
varieties, most of which were sent to the National Museum.</p>
<p>Advancing through Audubon Avenue, we soon find the
roof and floor approaching to form what is called Bunker Hill,
around which we pass by a narrow defile. The Mushroom
Beds attract our attention, to which we have already referred
as having cost far more than they ever returned by way of
profit, although the idea itself is feasible.</p>
<p>Above a floor encumbered by debris hang formations needing
an explanation. Limpid drops trickle through the roof,
saturated with bicarbonate of lime. The supply of water
is constant, but so meager as to drip instead of flow; and as
the dripping goes on each drop lays down its load as a ring
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
slight enough for a fairy&rsquo;s finger. Ring follows ring till a
pendant is formed like a pipestem. The pipestems thicken to the
size of candles, and often grow as large as tree-trunks. Occasionally
they broaden into elegant drapery, or are twisted into
fantastic shapes. All these stone icicles are called &ldquo;stalactites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such lime-laden drops as fall splash about and on evaporation
deposit, not rings, but films thin as tissue-paper, building
up stalagmites that are solid from their base upwards. Often
these downward and upward growths meet as stately shafts,
like the pillar named the Sentinel, which guards Olive&rsquo;s Bower
a few steps beyond it.</p>
<p>The general term &ldquo;dripstone&rdquo; is conveniently applied to
all these deposits, and their finer varieties are known to the
mineralogist as &ldquo;oriental alabaster.&rdquo; A central stalactite
in Olive&rsquo;s Bower is very large and cone-shaped, amid many
smaller ones. Below is a rampart, looking over which we see,
some twenty feet below, a limpid pool that reflects the overhanging
formations. Before leaving the subject of dripstone
it should be remarked that, chemically regarded, it is simply
the hard carbonate, not the bicarbonate, as is often alleged;
the latter being an unstable compound, readily changing on
any change of its conditions.</p>
<p>The pit which arrests our progress beyond Olive&rsquo;s Bower
might, if explored, prove this locality to be connected with
White&rsquo;s Cave, whose features it resembles. On returning to
the Rotunda we again inspect the historic relics of the War
of 1812, and mark the grooves cut in the limestone walls by
the hubs of the primitive cart-wheels that were slowly drawn
along by oxen to collect the nitrous earth for the saltpeter
vats. We notice that the bottoms of these vats were made of
small logs halved and grooved and laid in layers on supports;
the lower layer with its grooved surface up, to receive the second
layer in reversed position, making a method for conveying
the lye into reservoirs, whence it was pumped out to the crystallization
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
troughs. Dr. Call was the first to direct attention
to this ingenious device.</p>
<p>Again we forsake the Main Cave for a ramble through
Gothic Avenue, which is reached by a stairway just beyond
the vats. At the entrance to it is Booth&rsquo;s Amphitheatre,
where Edwin Booth is said to have recited a part of the play
of Hamlet. In early times a mummy was found in an adjoining
cave, and brought hither for exhibition. The alcove where
it reposed still bears the name of the Mummy&rsquo;s Niche. It was
afterward carried about through the West on exhibition, and
it was the writer&rsquo;s privilege to see it at that time. It was
naturally dessicated, and with its ornaments and garments
was regarded as a great curiosity. It remained in a museum
at Worcester, Mass., for many years, and is now in the National
Museum at Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>Hundreds of visitors have recorded their names in Register
Hall, either by scratching them on the wall with the knife
or smoking them there by their candles, or else by the less
conspicuous way of depositing their cards on the ledge set
apart for that purpose. Here, and also in parts of the Main
Cave, so-called &ldquo;monuments&rdquo; are built by piling up flat fragments
of stone in honor of individuals, States, or benevolent
organizations; a practice which incidentally has helped to clear
obstructions from the pathway in which we walk. The largest
of them all is quite properly the Kentucky Monument. The
effect in general, however, is to divert attention from the
natural attractions.</p>
<p>The hoary old stalactites, great and small, in Gothic Avenue
got their growth ages ago. The signs show that long ago the
Cave stream was diverted to lower channels, leaving the place
as dry as a tinder-box. The Post-Oak Pillar, the Pillars of
Hercules, Pompey and C&aelig;sar, and the Altar in Gothic Chapel,
are interesting and picturesque, and give the guides occasion
for many legends and jokes; but do not warrant the conclusions
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
drawn by Dr. Binkerd and others as to the age of
the Mammoth Cave, judging by the alleged slow growth of
dripstone in a locality where there is now no growth at all.
There is no doubt as to the vast antiquity of the great cavern,
whose remote origin is by many referred to the Tertiary Period;
but it must be remembered that geological changes are by no
means uniform, and that catastrophe has evidently played
a conspicuous part in cave-making.</p>
<p>There is not enough moisture now in Gothic Avenue to
make the atoms float in the air. Toss a handful of dust up,
and it falls back like so much shot. I saw a party of young
people who came here directly from the ballroom, and not a
particle of dust spotted the trailing robes or clung to the polished
boots. Wood here undergoes tardy decay, and fresh
beef and other meats keep sweet for a long time, and then
dry up like the old mummy which was mentioned as having
once been placed here.</p>
<p>Pompey Pillar is named for a negro miner, a raw hand,
who in old times trudged in here alone for &ldquo;peter-dirt&rdquo; and
lost his way. He stumbled, put out his lamp, and was in a
frenzy. When at last he saw his half-naked negro comrades
approach, swinging their torches and shouting, he took them
for demons, and shouted lustily for mercy. It took no little
shaking and punching to convince him that he was yet alive
and in Mammoth Cave, instead of elsewhere.</p>
<p>It may tax the imagination to find the resemblance to an
Elephant&rsquo;s Head in the stalactite so called; but once found
the grotesque likeness is vivid.</p>
<p>A curious legend told of the Gothic Chapel and its Bridal
Altar is verified. A Kentucky belle gave her heart to a gallant
Southron. But her mother, who opposed the match, made
her swear never to marry any man on the face of the earth.
Shortly the lovers eloped and were hotly pursued; but before
they were caught they were married in this novel Gretna
Green. Taxed with her broken pledge, the bride replied:
&ldquo;Mother, dear, it was not marrying any man &lsquo;on the face of
the earth&rsquo; to wed my own true love in this underground chapel.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Few ladies fail to rest awhile in the Old Arm Chair, a stalagmite
naturally fitted as a seat. Jenny Lind sat here and sang
one of her sweet songs; and many a song has been sung here
since. A slender projection beyond it is called the Lover&rsquo;s Leap,
from whose point an illumination shows a wild mass of rocks
amid which runs a narrow path styled the Elbow Crevice,
whose walls are fantastically folded. We escape from the ragged
edge of what is known as Joseph&rsquo;s Pit, and note in passing the
Devil&rsquo;s Cooling Tub. Gatewood&rsquo;s Dining-Table is a huge flat
rock directly under Napoleon&rsquo;s Dome, from whose apex it fell.</p>
<p>Gratz Avenue, into which we enter, is not on the same
Cave level as the Gothic Avenue. Unless we take care we
may walk directly into the exquisitely clear waters of Lake
Purity, a small mirror-like pool. Beyond it we go, winding
to and fro, till at the foot of a small cliff we find the entrance
to Annette&rsquo;s Dome, one of the prettiest in all the Cave. Shaler&rsquo;s
Brook spouts from the wall and runs merrily and musically into
a smaller room, whence it vanishes, falling by a leap of seventy
feet into Lee&rsquo;s Cistern. In Gratz Avenue are found blind crustaceans,
crickets, and other forms of life described by Dr. Call.</p>
<p>We now retrace our way to the Main Cave, passing various
objects noticed in the first route. Shortly beyond the Giant&rsquo;s
Coffin the Main Cave turns suddenly to the left at the Acute
Angle, where the burning magnesium makes visible the vast
dimensions of the cavern by illuminating it in two directions
at once. A village in the vicinity formerly sheltered a colony
of consumptives who, in 1843, and by medical advice, took
up their abode here, hopeful for relief or cure because of the
uniform temperature and the naturally oxygenated air. The
sunless days passed slowly by till the pitiful experiment was
abandoned as a failure, as was also the experiment by the
invalids to make trees and shrubbery grow around their dismal
huts. Some of the victims of the &ldquo;white plague&rdquo; lie buried
in the grove back of the Hotel garden, while others died soon
after returning to their homes. There were originally thirteen
cottages and tents, the only ones now remaining being two
roofless stone structures beyond the Acute Angle.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>A strangely beautiful transformation scene is wrought for
us in the Star Chamber, a hall seventy feet wide, sixty feet
high, and several hundred feet long. The ceiling is coated
with manganese dioxide, and through this black background
emerge hundreds of brilliant white stars, made by the efflorescence
of the sulphate of magnesia. These are invisible at first,
and the magnificent archway sweeps above us in midnight
blackness. Long benches are ranged against the right-hand
wall, on which the guide seats us, while he collects our lamps
and vanishes with them behind a jutting rock. Then comes
the marvelous illusion. The roof seems lifted to an immense
height. Indeed, we seem to gaze from a ca&ntilde;on directly up
to the starry sky. Cloud-shadows are thrown athwart it by
adroit manipulation. A meteor shoots across the vault. We
behold the mild glory of the Milky Way. Suddenly the guide
breaks in upon our exclamations of delight by saying, &ldquo;Good
night. I will see you again in the morning!&rdquo; He plunges
into a gorge. We are in utter darkness. The silence is so
perfect that we can hear our hearts beat. Presently a glimmer
comes from another direction, like a faint streak of dawn.
The aurora tinges the tips of the rocks; the horizon is bathed
in a rosy glow; a concert of cock-crowing, the lowing of cattle
and other barnyard sounds, answered by the barking of the
house-dog, seem to herald the rising sun; when the ventriloquial
guide appears, swinging his cluster of lamps and asking
how we liked the performance. Our response is a hearty
encore; after granting which the guide tells us that the second
route ends here, and he must pilot us back to the mouth of
the Cave and to the Hotel. Those who have witnessed the
wonders of the Star Chamber many times testify that the
charm never wanes.</p>

<br />From the Star Chamber to Violet City</h2>
<p>Familiar now with the features of the first part of the Main
Cave, we trudge along rapidly, till the guide cries &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;
We seem to hear the measured ticking of an old-fashioned
clock. We find the natural timepiece to be but the dripping
of water into a small basin hidden behind some rocks. The
drops fall only a few inches, one by one, as they may have
fallen for a thousand years; but such are the acoustic properties
of the place that the musical ticking is heard for a long
distance. The guide shows us also another pretty pool, made
by a tiny rill gushing from the solid wall; and he tells us the
story of a rambling blind boy, who won a living by his violin,
and who said that he &ldquo;wanted to <i>see</i> the Cave&rdquo; for himself.
Somehow he got apart from his companions, and when they
found the little boy he was sound asleep beside this tiny basin,
which has ever since been known as &ldquo;Wandering Willie&rsquo;s
Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening on to the Star Chamber, we resume our exploration
of the Main Cave. Beyond that hall of constellations,
the Grand Gallery&mdash;as it used to be called&mdash;sweeps to the
right, and the starry canopy changes to a &ldquo;mackerel-sky,&rdquo;
caused by the scaling-off of the black deposit on the ceiling,
thus exposing the white limestone. This is the Floating Cloud
Room. As we look aloft at the fleecy masses that seem to
float along, we notice a stout oak pole jutting from an inaccessible
crevice. When, why, how, and by whom was it put
there? In Lee&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notes of the Mammoth Cave,&rdquo; in 1835,
ancient fireplaces are mentioned, which were also shown to
myself by old Matt, in 1881, and which were hidden by broad
slabs along the margin of the Cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Curious objects are pointed out as we walk through Procter&rsquo;s
Arcade and Kinney&rsquo;s Arena, lofty and symmetrical enlargements
of the passageway. One of them is another stout pole
in a rift in the roof. The Keel-Boat (or the Whale) is an
enormous rock seventy feet long, and a tilted slab of limestone
is the Devil&rsquo;s Looking-Glass. Presently it begins to snow;
and our shouts make the flakes fall faster. Waving lamps
and lighted fire-balls augment the storm. Seeking an explanation,
we find that the ceiling is crusted with native Epsom
salts, whose crystals are thus dislodged, as well as more silently
by the growth of new crystals, falling, as saline snow till the
brown ledges are whitened by mimic snowdrifts.</p>
<p>No stooping or crawling has to be done in the Main Cave,
and the floor is everywhere dry. Formerly the tilting slabs
of limestone made walking difficult, but now these are removed
so as to give us a fairly smooth road throughout. The serpentine
winding known as the S-bend expands to a width of
one hundred and seventy-five feet and keeps that width for
five hundred and fifty feet; but midway it meets a grand
crossing, that increases the width to about four hundred feet.
Fox Avenue, near by, encloses a large cave-island.</p>
<p>Dr. Nahum Ward and other early explorers fancied the
Main Cave as formerly an underground Nile, and its rocky
masses ruined cities; and on the first maps they were numbered
First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth City. The first in
order was called the Chief City, while the fourth, now familiar
to us by that name, was the Temple. This fact explains some
conflicting accounts by early and more recent authors. Robert
M. Bird was responsible for these changes, giving the name
of Wright&rsquo;s Rotunda to the First City in honor of his friend,
Prof. C. A. Wright, M. D.</p>
<p>This is one of the most spacious rooms in the Cave, being
shaped like the letter T, its length about five hundred feet
and its width at the transept about three hundred and fifty
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
feet. The ceiling is quite level throughout, but the floor is
irregular, causing the space between roof and floor to vary
from ten to forty-five feet. When several chemical fires are
ignited at distant points simultaneously the effect is superb.
Ragged cliffs divide this prodigious area, making a sort of
great island, beyond which by climbing through the so-called
Chimneys those who wish can reach the Black Chambers above,
extending for several hundred feet. The walls and domes
of these chambers are coated with the black oxide of
manganese, and the enormous rocks lie scattered in the wildest
disorder.</p>
<p>Returning to Wright&rsquo;s Rotunda and taking the other arm
of the T, we presently find ourselves looking directly into a
steep hollow, or pit, into which the Cataracts tumble from
orifices in the roof, and with resounding force after a rainfall.
Those who risk a descent part way down the pit and climb
over a wall may find their way into the Solitary Chambers
and the Fairy Grotto, though the difficulty of access prevents
these places from being ordinarily exhibited. A &ldquo;tumble-down&rdquo;
to the left of the Cataract chasm might correctly be
regarded as the termination of the Main Cave.</p>
<p>A passage to the left opens from Cataract Hall to a lofty
avenue commonly spoken of as a continuation of the Main Cave,
but really on another level. The limestone slabs that used
to clatter under our feet and endanger our equilibrium have
been made firm or else removed, and we easily proceed through
the Gorge and across the portal of what once was styled the
Temple, but has long been known as the Chief City.</p>
<p>By my measurement the room is four hundred and fifty
feet long, with an average width of one hundred and seventy-five
feet; but others have made the dimensions larger. The
utmost height does not exceed one hundred and twenty-five
feet. The maximum width, as measured by Dr. Call, is two
hundred and eighty-seven feet. The area covers about two
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
acres. And over this vast space springs a solid and seamless
canopy of gray limestone, that has thus lifted its majestic arch
for thousands of years. Dr. Bird found here, in 1837, aboriginal
relics &ldquo;in astonishing, unaccountable quantities.&rdquo; Formerly
these were heaped as bonfires to illuminate the chamber;
but even yet cartloads remain of half-burnt cane-torches,
fragments of woven moccasins, and other objects of interest,
to reward search amid crevices and crannies. The theory is
that the Indians made this place their council chamber, or
else their stronghold of refuge from enemies.</p>
<p>Fascinated with the local attractions and possibly too forgetful
of the weariness of my guide, I lingered once till midnight,
prowling amid the fastnesses of the Chief City. Noticing
presently the utter silence that prevailed, I returned to where
my guide had been left on guard, only to find a couple of
lamps and a strip of brown paper on which he had scrawled
the words, &ldquo;It is midnight and I got tired and went out.&rdquo;
The guide had really deserted me, and the only thing to do
was to await the coming of comrades, who would surely hunt
me up, as they did after the lapse of an hour or so. Extinguishing
the lamps meanwhile, fancy was given full play to
people the mysterious council chamber with ghosts of dusky
warriors, till there seemed to be a rush of whispers and other
imaginary sounds that were really caused, I suppose, by the
coursing of the blood through my veins. It was easy to realize
that a person actually lost in Mammoth Cave might soon be
so bewildered as to lose his reason. Even in my own case it
was a relief to break the spell, as I did, by simply striking a
match and trimming anew the flickering flame of my lamps.
Every observant visitor has seen with pleasure the assemblage
of rocks and the overarching canopy aglow with Bengal lights
or burning magnesium, and has commented on the singular
fact that the lofty dome seems to follow him as he retires from
its protection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>St. Catherine City, which lies beyond, is at the intersection
of the Blue Spring Branch and Blackall Avenue with the
main passageway. The latter, recently named in honor of the
veteran cave-hunter, Dr. C. R. Blackall, of Philadelphia, ends
in a funnel-shaped pit bearing the name of Symmes&rsquo; Pit,
probably in memory of Captain John Cleves Symmes, of
Newport, Kentucky, whose theory gained much attention
formerly&mdash;that our globe was a hollow sphere with an opening
at the poles, and that within were races of men and animals
different from those on the surface. At a public meeting
held at Frankfort, a resolution was adopted to the effect that
the United States Congress should fit out an expedition to the
Arctic Circle under his command, in order to find, if possible,
the mysterious Polar pit for which this Cave pit was named.</p>
<p>Our course, however, leads us to Waldach&rsquo;s Dome (in
memory of Charles Waldach, the pioneer in cave-photography)
and Hains&rsquo; Dome (in honor of his successor, Ben Hains),
both of them symmetrical and noble domes, rising to oval
ceilings above smooth floors of sand. In the Garret we find
flakes of Epsom salts like those found in the Snow Room.
Bending low through Mayme&rsquo;s Stoopway, we reach what to
Dr. Call and myself seemed to be an impenetrable wall, to
which we gave what we thought the fitting name of &ldquo;Ultima
Thule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1908 Mr. Max Kaemper, of Germany, undertook
a complete exploration of Mammoth Cave, assisted by Edward
Bishop, guide, the results of which are exclusively for the
owners of the Cave. Their observations led them to suspect
that a certain tumble-down in the Sandstone Avenue might
be identical with the tumble-down known as Ultima Thule.
Hence they attacked a crawl-way near the latter, and by
patiently removing many limestone fragments they wormed
their way through to an oval hall, one hundred and sixty feet
long by one hundred and twenty feet wide and sixty feet high,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
now named, for its discoverer, Kaemper Hall. An unseen
waterfall, by whose music they had been led onward, was
now seen to dash down an abyss they named, for the guide,
Bishop&rsquo;s Pit. Another is the &ldquo;Parrish Pit,&rdquo; so called for
Norman A. Parrish, of Buffalo, New York. These are the first
of a series of eleven pits, the others not yet being named.</p>
<p>Fifty steps to the right is a short passage where an iron
gate is now fixed, opening into a symmetrical chamber seventy-five
feet in diameter and of about the same height, rising by
vaulted arches and closing above in a beautiful circle. This
is Elizabeth&rsquo;s Dome, named for a sister of Mr. Kaemper. The
exit is by the Grand Portal, an arch sixty feet wide and fifty
feet high, commanding one of the most magnificent views in
all the underground world.</p>
<p>On visiting the locality soon after its discovery, I seated
myself on Albert&rsquo;s Stairway, while one of my companions
ignited Bengal lights here and there, and the other used an
automobile searchlight brought in for the purpose; and thus
they gave me my first view of the wonderful region, to which
the general name of Violet City is given, in honor of Mrs.
Violet Blair Janin, the wife of Trustee Albert C. Janin, and
the fair owner of one third of the Mammoth Cave estate.
Special features are Blair Castle and the Marble Temple, whose
environs are styled &ldquo;Walhalla,&rdquo; for the fabled realm above
the clouds where dwell the heroes and demigods of old German
mythology.</p>
<p>Picking up our torches again, and carrying my acetylene
bicycle lamp, to which I had fixed a convenient handle, we
followed a natural pathway near the wall on the left, that
led us from place to place. We found that Violet City is two
hundred and fifty feet long by one hundred and twenty-five
wide, rivaled only in size by Wright&rsquo;s Rotunda and the Chief
City, and greatly exceeding them in beauty. A sandstone
cave-in at the end seems to lend color to the idea that Sandstone
Avenue, or some similar place, is near. These fallen
blocks are cemented together by a profusion of onyx.
Stalactites and stalagmites abound everywhere, varying
in color from the purest white alabaster through every imaginable
shade. The upper central part of the hall is crowned by
three masses of fluted white onyx, glistening with exquisite
crystals, while from the roof hang in fine array stalactites
eight or ten feet long. The right wall is decorated with pure
white formations, and the left wall is coated with rich brown
onyx. A row of stalactites of varying length emit musical
tones when struck by the knuckles, and by skillful percussion
simple airs can be played on them. These are the Chimes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="626" />
<div class="pcap">The Chimes</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Other attractions excite surprise. The Beer Mug, like a
mug of foaming ale, the Ripe Tomato, a rare bit of red onyx,
and other odd specimens of natural mimicry are here. One
familiar with the brilliant creations found in the wonderful
caverns of Luray might easily imagine himself in that Virginian
fairyland instead of in Mammoth Cave. Thus far these
marvelous treasures have been kept untouched by vandal
fingers, such as have robbed or destroyed elsewhere what should
have been most jealously guarded in the greatest cavern known.</p>
<p>In his zeal to open a passage from Violet City to Sandstone
Avenue Mr. Kaemper obtained permission to use explosives.
Thus he made considerable progress. However, the indications
were that he was likely to burst through to the surface somewhere,
instead of into Sandstone Avenue, and accordingly he
desisted. In either case the result might have been advantageous.
An opening into Sandstone Avenue would enable
visitors to make the circuit through the Main Cave and Violet
City, and return by the Long Route, without having to retrace
their steps. On the other hand, an exit to the surface from near
Violet City would enable them to return by coach to the Cave
Hotel without a wearisome tramp over ground already trodden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>

<div class="pcap">The Marble Temple</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>To convince those who, like the writer, are skeptical as
to the proximity of Violet City and Sandstone Avenue, Kaemper
and Bishop repaired, one to the first place and the other to
the second, agreeing on a fixed moment by the watch when
they would fire revolvers and likewise hammer on the rocks.
The pistol shots were inaudible, but the blows on the walls
were faintly heard. By similar sound-tests it was determined
that Wright&rsquo;s Rotunda is directly above the Serpent Hall
(beyond Echo River), so that it might be possible to connect
them by a stairway through an artificial shaft. Incidentally
I may state, however, as showing how far sound may travel
through the rocks and their mysterious crevices, that, while
in the Chief City, we heard the steam-cars running over the
Mammoth Cave Railroad.</p>
<p>But now no short cut is provided for us, and we return as
we came, carrying with us delightful memories of the New
Discovery.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><br /><span class="small">ROUTE IV</span>
<br />To the Maelstr&ouml;m and Hovey&rsquo;s Cathedral</h2>
<p>Let no one in ordinary vigor forego the remarkable scenes
of what is frequently known as &ldquo;The Long Route,&rdquo; simply
because longer than either of the other three. The trip is
varied by the boat-ride, the midday lunch, and the occasional
stops at points of interest. The spirits are also sustained
by the exhilarating Cave atmosphere.</p>
<p>We may imagine ourselves, therefore, as having landed at
Rocky Inlet, on the farther shore of the wonderful Echo River.
Soon we are greeted by the music of the waterfall in Cascade
Hall. To our right are Stephenson&rsquo;s Avenue, whose principal
attraction is Neptune&rsquo;s Cups, and the Aquarius Avenue, leading
to Roaring River; both of which offer matters of interest to
the scientist, but are never visited by ordinary tourists, who
hasten on to other scenes more accessible. Wellington&rsquo;s
Galleries are peculiar shelf-like projections. At Dripping
Spring we find a few stalactites. We pass in safety what the
guides irreverently name the Infernal Regions, Pluto&rsquo;s Dome,
and Old Scratch Hall&mdash;the latter being surprisingly scratched
all over, while the only trails of serpents in Serpent Hall are
the freaks of nature observed as winding channels overhead.
The fact should be noted that this is high-water mark for
Echo River in time of flood. Hence we take particular interest
in the opening from Serpent Hall to Ganter Avenue as our
only exit at such times, running as it does for eight thousand five
hundred feet to the Wooden Bowl Room, near the Giant&rsquo;s Coffin
in the Main Cave. We are assured, however, that visitors
are seldom so unlucky as to get caught by such a sudden rise
of the waters. We have now entered Silliman&rsquo;s Avenue,
named for the late Professor Silliman of Yale University. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
the Valley-Way Side-Cut are singular crystals of gypsum that
grow in the ground, whence they are dug up, like so many
potatoes. Beyond the Hill of Fatigue stands the Great Western,
resembling an ocean steamer, her helm hard-a-port. By
mounting a ledge between the Vale of Flowers and Rabbit
Rock, and following Rhoda Arcade for about five hundred
yards amid interesting incrustations, we find three domes,
named for different members of the Jesup family, the highest
and most symmetrical being Lucy&rsquo;s Dome, connected by a
lofty archway with the other two. Immense alabaster curtains
hang on the walls, and the effect when illuminated from
the archway is grand.</p>
<p>On the left of Silliman&rsquo;s Avenue is a hall with fine acoustic
properties, thirty feet wide, forty long, and twenty high,
where the famous Norwegian violinist Ole Bull is said to have
once given a special performance; and hence it bears his name,
Ole Bull&rsquo;s Concert Hall. The wild and rugged pass which,
on the map, seems to be a continuance of Silliman&rsquo;s Avenue,
is really on a lower level, and is well named &ldquo;El Ghor&rdquo; (The
Gorge). It winds about like a forsaken river bed, which it
undoubtedly is, and offers many surprising sights. One such
is the Fly Chamber, in which swarms of house-flies seem to
have settled on the walls and ceiling. Examination proves
them to be so many crystals of black oxide of manganese.
The Hanging Rocks, the Sheep-shelter, and the Victoria Crown
are formations whose names suggest their shape. Immediately
over El Ghor is Corinne&rsquo;s Dome, nine feet wide and about
forty feet high. The guide points out what he styles Suicide
Rock, and when you innocently ask him &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; his ready
reply is, &ldquo;Because it hung itself.&rdquo; The Black Hole of Calcutta
is an ugly black pit on the left of the pass. El Ghor continues
on for some distance, but we leave it after refreshing ourselves
at Hebe&rsquo;s Spring, a clear pool four feet in diameter by a foot
and a half deep, and said to be impregnated with sulphur;
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
a fact of interest&mdash;it might easily come from the reduction of
gypsum or Epsom salt.</p>
<p>Stevenson, who was here in 1861, says, &ldquo;There is a short
avenue, or rather a hole, leading from El Ghor to a sheet of
water called Mystic River, which has not been explored, as
they have never been able to get a boat in there.&rdquo; Other
early writers mention Mystic River, but Dr. Call and myself
were unable to find it. Possibly it is identical with the stream
in Martel Avenue; but no one would ever think of a &ldquo;boat&rdquo;
in connection with the latter.</p>
<p>Boone Avenue, diverging from El Ghor to our left at a point
five thousand eight hundred and twenty yards from the mouth
of the Cave, was for many years blocked by a stone stairway,
recently removed. Important discoveries were made in this
direction in 1907, to which we shall presently give attention.</p>
<p>Now, however, we climb up through an uninviting hole
at our right that admits us to an upper tier of caverns. When
the last man is through we burn blue fire, and are surprised
to find ourselves in a stone vineyard. Nodules and globules
simulate clusters on clusters of luscious grapes, gleaming with
parti-colored tints through dripping dew. No covetous hand
is allowed to pluck the marvelous vintage of Mary&rsquo;s Vineyard;
which, after all, the mineralogist explains as simply calcium
carbonate coated with the black oxide of iron.</p>
<p>Washington Hall, smoke-stained and its floor strewn with
relics of hundreds of lunch-parties in former days, is mainly
interesting as the place whence two grand avenues diverge,
namely, Marion Avenue, not included in our route, and Cleaveland
Avenue, so named for the late mineralogist of that name.
This avenue is one of the great &ldquo;lions&rdquo; of Mammoth Cave,
and many think more of it than of all the other Cave lions put
together. It has indeed a marvelous beauty peculiarly its
own. Walls and ceiling everywhere are decorated by mimic
leaves and flowers, in an infinite variety of form. There is
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
hardly a plant known to botany that does not find its counterpart
here; but roses, camellias, and chrysanthemums are the
most common varieties. In many parts of this treasury of
crystals there is not a space as large as your hand that is not
decorated by dazzling blossoms; and even the floor sparkles
with bright fragments of flowers demolished by vandal visitors.
Dr. John Locke, of Cincinnati, gave these Cave rosettes the
name of &ldquo;oulopholites,&rdquo; meaning literally &ldquo;curled-leaf-stones.&rdquo;
Among descriptive names assigned to different parts of this
enchanted realm are Snowball Room, Flora&rsquo;s Garden, Orpha&rsquo;s
Garden, the Cross of Flowers, the Last Rose of Summer, Crypt
of Jewels, and Charlotte&rsquo;s Grotto. These are not all of them
in Cleaveland Avenue, but some are in its vicinity. It is a
vast crystalline region, through which one may wander for
fully two miles and occasionally find, in some secluded nook,
the trailing vines, stalks of celery, and stag&rsquo;s antlers described
by early tourists.</p>
<p>Surfeited at length by such floral splendors, we suddenly
emerge into Call&rsquo;s Rotunda and clamber up the loosely piled
blocks of limestone called the Rocky Mountains, from whose
summit we look down into the Dismal Hollow, whose gloom
our red fires hardly succeed in dispelling. Three avenues
branch from Call&rsquo;s Rotunda; one to Sandstone Avenue, which
Kaemper considers to be in proximity to Violet City; another,
Franklin Avenue, ends in Serena&rsquo;s Arbor; and the third leads
directly to a large room named, for the former owner of the
Cave, Croghan&rsquo;s Hall. It is sixty feet in diameter and thirty
feet high. Here we find, the yawning chasm known as the
Maelstr&ouml;m, which by my measurement is eighty-eight feet
deep, though often described as far deeper than that. It is
claimed that W. C. Prentice was the first to descend to the
bottom of this abyss. According to Mr. Procter the same
feat was afterward accomplished by Mr. Richard Babbitt.
Mr. F. J. Stevenson, of London, in his letters to his mother,
tells the story at great length of his own descent into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
Maelstr&ouml;m in the presence of thirty witnesses and with the
help of two guides, Nicholas Branford and Frank de Monbrun.
On the 15th of May, 1905, Mr. Benjamin F. Einbigler and
John M. Nelson, guide, were lowered by ropes held by Edward
Hawkins and Levi Woodson, guides, the rope-length being
exactly ninety-seven feet eight inches. Their account differs
materially from the former descriptions, but we will not try
to adjust their statements in this manual. The most that the
visitor will be apt to do will be to peer over the brink and
wonder that anybody should venture down such an awful
abyss. This is estimated to be ninety-six hundred yards from
the entrance to the Cave, and is often spoken of as &ldquo;the end
of Mammoth Cave.&rdquo; But who can tell where the real &ldquo;end&rdquo;
of so vast a labyrinth may be? At any rate here we turn and
retrace our steps through the paradise of Cave flowers until
we reach Mary&rsquo;s Vineyard and descend to the level of El Ghor.</p>
<p>Here, if we have the time, strength, and inclination, we may
enter Boone Avenue, which has been known for many years,
and visit what is practically a new part, of the Cave, though
there are signs of its having been explored long ago by unknown
visitors.</p>
<p>A well-worn path leads us to a chasm, down whose slope
we pick our way to a lower level known on Stephen Bishop&rsquo;s
old map as Miriam Avenue. A narrow and winding way,
called Pinson&rsquo;s Pass, leads into a long and noble avenue which
is named Martel Avenue, in honor of the famous cave-hunter
of France, Edward A. Martel. The point where we enter it
is called, from its peculiar shape, Bottle Hall. Were we to
go to the left in Martel Avenue we should find the path rugged
and difficult, but would be rewarded by seeing Helictite Hall,
where abound those curious twisted and distorted stalactites
known as helictites. Several small passages branch off from
the avenue, which finally terminates in Galloway&rsquo;s Dome.</p>
<p>The right-hand portion of Martel Avenue brings us soon
to the bed of a brook that must at times be deeply covered
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
by flowing water. Ripple marks of sand alternate with flat
masses of jet-black polished flint. Knots of wood, roots of
corn-stalks, and other objects indicate that they were recently
swept down hither from the surface. Two adjacent domes
are named for the intrepid guide, John M. Nelson, but beyond
them some hardy pioneer had inscribed on a rock the date 1848.
Mr. Norman A. Parrish came as far as this in 1904, but the
distinction of availing himself of footholds over a risky limestone
slip and crossing where others had turned back belongs
to Mr. B. F. Einbigler, already mentioned as having descended
the Maelstr&ouml;m. For him the great overhanging dome is
named, while a still grander one about a hundred yards beyond
was named by him &ldquo;Edna Dome&rdquo; for his sister, who subsequently
visited it. Instead of narrowing to an apex, as most
domes do, Edna Dome broadens at the top, seeming to open
into a cross-cavern. This conjecture remains to be verified
by some climber.</p>
<p>Edward Hawkins scaled the wall of the pit underneath
Einbigler&rsquo;s Dome, May 15, 1907, being followed by Einbigler,
Bransford, and at another visit by Mr. H. M. Pinson, who
took along the head-light of an automobile for illumination.
This searchlight was still there on the occasion of my own
visit, on the 18th of June, 1907, a month afterward, in company
with William Bransford and Frank Barry, guides. Passing
through Hawkins&rsquo; Way and scaling a wall at its end, we were
on the level floor of a dome sixty feet in diameter and from
one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet high. A tall arched
gateway opened from this into a second dome of equal size;
and through similar gateways we entered in succession five
vast domes arranged as a sigmoidal group. From the fifth
a window opens into an irregular room, where a downfall of
rocks blocks further progress. In this fifth dome also a waterfall
leaps from the apex to the floor, where it vanishes into
a chasm. The majestic walls rise in horizontal tiers, each tier
about ten feet in thickness and fringed by beautiful stalactites.
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
The mighty masonry ascends in narrowing circles till the
powerful searchlight barely enables us to discern the oval
white tablet forming the apex, girt by onyx pendants. Vertically
the walls are richly corrugated from top to bottom.
The entire series of five united domes is four times the
magnitude of Gorin&rsquo;s Dome. Ages on ages were needed
for the chemical and mechanical action whereby this surprising
cathedral was carved in silence broken only by the
wild, pattering waterfall or the heavier cataract. Let me
anew express my obligation to the Mammoth Cave management
for having marked their appreciation of my long-continued
and enthusiastic interest in their wonderful cavern
by naming, with the approval of the discoverer and the guides,
this remarkable group of domes &ldquo;Hovey&rsquo;s Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glance at the map will show, that Kaemper and Bishop
went beyond what has just been described, and found two
domes, to one of which Mr. Kaemper gave the name of a German
lady, calling it &ldquo;Gerta&rsquo;s Grotto,&rdquo; and the other he named
&ldquo;Creighton&rsquo;s Dome,&rdquo; for an early and otherwise unknown
explorer, whose footprints were found there, and who left
his name carved on the rocks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let it again be stated that the aim of this hand-book
is mainly to help the visitor to understand those routes
over which guides ordinarily conduct parties. The known
avenues and minor passageways, if placed end to end, would
exceed one hundred and fifty miles by a conservative estimate.
Sixty-nine pits and thirty-nine domes, counting only those of
great magnitude, are known and located on the surveys of 1908,
besides many lateral enlargements, after the style of Wright&rsquo;s
Rotunda and the Chief City. Yet we dare not say that this
immense cavern has been completely explored. Those most
familiar with its surprising dimensions think it possible that
resolute men, beginning where others have left off, might find as
much more new territory as has already been described in the vast
subterranean realm known as the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.</p>
